# Dice Multiplayer

### Rules:

1. **Roll the Dice**: Roll the dice as many times as you want before pressing "Hold".
2. **Accumulating Points**: The number on the dice will keep accumulating as long as it is not "1".
3. **Rolling a "1"**: If you roll a "1", your accumulated points for that round become 0, and no points are added to your score. The turn then passes to the other player.
4. **Holding**: If you press "Hold" before rolling a "1", all accumulated points for that round are added to your total score, and the turn passes to the other player.
